# Plugin Eval Report: agents-init

## At a Glance
- Score: 95/100
- Grade: A
- Risk: medium
- Checks: 0 fail, 1 warn, 2 info
- Active budget: 106 tokens (good)
- Observed usage: not supplied

## Why It Matters
- 1 warning signal still need cleanup before this feels polished.
- best-practice is the largest source of score loss at -4.5 points.
- Budget pressure is not the dominant issue right now.
- No observed usage is attached yet, so budget conclusions are still based on static estimates.

## Fix First
- [warn/warning] The description does not clearly advertise when the skill should trigger. Why: Best-practice gaps usually do not break the workflow immediately, but they make the skill harder to understand and improve. Fix: Rewrite the description to include a clear 'Use when ...' trigger sentence.

## Recommended Next Step
- Fix the top findings and rerun the report
- Why: A short pass on the highest-value findings will improve trust, readability, and the signal quality of future benchmarks.
- Chat request: "What should I fix first?"
- Local command: `plugin-eval start <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --request 'What should I fix first?' --format markdown`

<summary>Improvement brief</summary>

- Raise the evaluation from grade A (95/100) with a focus on the highest-signal structural and budget issues first.
- Goal: Rewrite the description to include a clear 'Use when ...' trigger sentence.
- Measure: token-usage-observer
- Measure: task-outcome-scorecard
- Suggested prompt: Use the skill-creator guidance to improve agents-init. Keep the structure compact and move bulky details into references or scripts. Define success measures with these toolsets: token-usage-observer, task-outcome-scorecard. Address description-trigger-weak: The description does not clearly advertise when the skill should trigger.

<summary>Measurement plan</summary>

Combine cost, outcome, and trust signals so you can tell whether the skill or plugin is genuinely helping instead of only looking well-structured on paper.

- Token Usage Observer [high] Measure how many tokens the skill or plugin actually burns in representative runs. Signals: observed_usage_sample_count, observed_input_tokens_avg, observed_total_tokens_avg, estimate_vs_observed_input_ratio. Evidence: Responses API usage logs, Codex-like session exports, JSONL traces captured from local benchmarking harnesses.
- Task Outcome Scorecard [high] Measure whether the skill helps users finish the intended job with fewer retries and less cleanup. Signals: task_success_rate, first_pass_success_rate, retry_rate, human_override_rate. Evidence: Task run logs, Structured user acceptance checklist, Before/after comparison runs on the same prompts.
- Tool Call Audit [medium] Check whether the agent uses the right tools, arguments, and sequencing when the skill is active. Signals: tool_call_success_rate, invalid_tool_argument_rate, recoverable_tool_failure_rate. Evidence: Tool invocation traces, Recorded sessions, Golden-path scenario replays.
- Latency And Efficiency [medium] Track whether the skill speeds users up enough to justify its cost. Signals: p50_time_to_first_acceptable_answer_seconds, p95_time_to_task_completion_seconds, tokens_per_successful_run. Evidence: Benchmark harness timings, Manual stopwatch runs on canonical tasks, Responses API timestamps combined with usage logs.
- Human Rubric Review [medium] Capture clarity, trust, and usefulness signals that automated checks will miss. Signals: clarity_score_avg, confidence_score_avg, follow_up_question_rate. Evidence: Reviewer scorecards, Team rubric sheets, Annotated transcripts.

<summary>Use From Codex Chat</summary>

Start with a natural chat request, then let plugin-eval show the exact local command sequence behind it.

Start with this chat request: "Evaluate this skill."
Why this path: Plugin Eval recommended Evaluate Skill from the current local state for this skill.
Quick local entrypoint: plugin-eval start <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --request 'Evaluate this skill.' --format markdown
Plugin Eval will run first: plugin-eval analyze <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --format markdown

Other chat requests you can use:
- Full Skill Analysis: say "Give me a full analysis of this skill, including benchmark setup." -> plugin-eval analyze <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --format markdown
- Evaluate Skill: say "Evaluate this skill." -> plugin-eval analyze <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --format markdown
- Explain Token Budget: say "Explain the token budget for this skill." -> plugin-eval explain-budget <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --format markdown
- Measure Real Token Usage: say "Measure the real token usage of this skill." -> plugin-eval init-benchmark <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init
- Benchmark With Starter Scenarios: say "Help me benchmark this skill." -> plugin-eval init-benchmark <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init
- Start Here: say "What should I run next?" -> plugin-eval analyze <implementation-worktree>/skills/agents-init --format markdown
